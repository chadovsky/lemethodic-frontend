# FluentPath Backlog

**Source of truth** for FluentPath sprint work. Maintained in the frontend repo because most active work is here, but covers both frontend and backend.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-24
**Sprint window:** April 21 – May 4, 2026

## How this file works

- Every ticket has a unique F-0xx ID. IDs are never reused or renumbered.
- Tickets reference repos by their local paths: `fluentpath-frontend/` or `tcf-oral-tool/`.
- Status markers: ✅ shipped · 🔄 in progress · 📋 queued · ⏸ deferred
- When a ticket is closed, mark ✅ and leave it in place. Do not delete.
- When a new ticket is created, append it with the next available F-0xx number.
- When a ticket spawns sub-work, either break it into new F-0xx tickets OR add numbered sub-items. Do not nest sub-phases beyond one level.

  - Frontend: API plumbing (lib/api, lib/auth, lib/types, lib/onboarding)
  - Frontend: Login screen at /login
  - Frontend: Signup screen at /signup with ?trial= query param
  - Frontend: Paywall CTAs rewired to /signup
  - Frontend: Auth gates via ProtectedRoute on all protected routes
  - Frontend: Root route auth-aware redirect
  - Frontend: HomeScreen real user data (name, countdown, 16-lesson progress)
  - Frontend: useVerifyAuth hook — validates stored tokens via /api/auth/me
  - Frontend: Auto-clearAuth on 401 from any API call
  - Onboarding store wiring: every step writes to useOnboardingStore on change
  - /test-drive route deleted (deferred post-launch)
  - Paywall heading renamed "Where you stand today"

F-061 ✅ Tâche 3 full loop shipped — audio capture, upload, backend analysis, diagnostic page render with real data. Verified end-to-end on recording #22.
  - `hooks/useAudioRecorder.ts` — MediaRecorder wrapper exposing status, error, durationMs, stream, startRecording, stopRecording, reset; Date.now()-based timing (sidesteps the hidden-tab throttle called out in F-076); releases getUserMedia tracks on stop/reset/unmount so the browser recording indicator doesn't linger
  - Maps getUserMedia errors (NotAllowedError, NotFoundError, NotReadableError, SecurityError) to human-readable copy; "permission" keyword in the string is what Tache3Session uses to switch into the permission-help card
  - `components/speaking/VuMeter.tsx` — stream prop drives a Web Audio AnalyserNode (fftSize 64, smoothing 0.55) read via requestAnimationFrame; AudioContext torn down on stream change / unmount; falls back to idle bars when no stream
  - `components/speaking/Tache3Session.tsx` — wired to useAudioRecorder; phase state machine (prep → recording → processing → error); 3-minute hard cap via useEffect on durationMs; stopRecording idempotency guard; CountdownTimer driven from durationMs in count-up mode
  - Upload path: `api.sessions.createRecording(topicId, blob, { targetLevel, uiLanguage, examProfile })` posts multipart to /api/recordings/upload; on success router.push(`/diagnostic?session=${id}`); on failure, blob is cached in a ref so the retry button re-uploads the same audio
  - Permission denial UX: dedicated "Microphone access needed" card with retry that re-enters prep and waits for a fresh user gesture (some browsers require this after denial)
  - `app/diagnostic/page.tsx` — reads `session` search param, calls `api.sessions.getDiagnostic`, renders real 4-couche scores (couchesToRows sorted worst-first), goulet, and up to 3 ordonnance steps (tops up with mock cards if backend returns <3); peach loader during fetch; dedicated error card with retry; falls back to mock data when no session param (so /diagnostic still works for design review)
  - Topic slug parsing is defensive: numeric slug → topic_id, non-numeric → fallback to 1 (see queued F-061.1 for the real picker + slug resolver)
  - tsc --noEmit: clean except the pre-existing TargetScoreSelect.tsx:98 error noted under "Known issues"
  - Out of scope and deferred to F-062/F-063: Tâche 1 and Tâche 2 session wiring (they share the useAudioRecorder + VuMeter primitives but have different state machines — multi-turn conversations vs single recording)

## Shipped — Week 2 (April 24)

F-061.2a ✅ Tâche 3 upload hotfix — tache_mode + error surfacing hardening
  - `lib/api.ts` `createRecording`: added `tacheMode` option accepting `1|2|3|'tache_1'|'tache_2'|'tache_3'`; normalizes bare digits to `tache_${n}` before posting. Defaults to `'tache_3'`. Unblocks F-062/F-063 reuse. Backend's `_validate_tache_mode_for_oral` rejects anything other than the full string form with a 400.
  - `components/speaking/Tache3Session.tsx` uploadBlob catch: differentiates `ApiError` (prefix with status code, surface backend `detail` verbatim), `TypeError` from fetch (actual network failure → "Couldn't reach the server"), and other errors (generic fallback). Stops mislabeling server-side errors as connectivity problems.
  - Tache3Session call site passes `tacheMode: 3` explicitly — normalized to `'tache_3'` at the API boundary.

F-061.2 ✅ Fetch method inference fix
  - Fixed fetch method inference in `lib/api.ts` `request()` — bodies now force POST. Affected `createRecording` and `uploadAudio` (would have bit F-062 too). Caller audit confirmed all 16 endpoints use correct methods.
  - Root cause: the request wrapper defaulted `method = 'GET'`. The two FormData callers passed only `{ formData: fd }` with no explicit method, so fetch was invoked with `GET + body` and the browser rejected it synchronously with "Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body." This silent failure never reached the Network tab and was only pinpointed by transient `REC:` / `SESSION:` console instrumentation (removed on ship).
  - Fix: `method = opts.method ?? (body !== undefined || formData ? 'POST' : 'GET')`. Explicit overrides still work; all other callers already passed `method: 'POST'` explicitly so only the two FormData sites changed behavior.

F-061.3 ✅ Ordonnance shape normalization
  - Backend `ordonnance` is a wrapper object `{ couche_ciblee, nom_couche, exercices: [...] }` with per-exercise keys `{numero, type, consigne, modele, phrase, options, reponse, explication}`. Empty recordings serialize as `{}` (per `recordings.py:645`). Frontend was typing it as `OrdonnanceStep[]` and calling `.slice(0, 3)` on the object — instant runtime TypeError on first real diagnostic render.
  - `lib/api.ts`: new `RawOrdonnanceExercise` / `RawOrdonnanceBlock` types + a dedicated `mapOrdonnance(raw: unknown)` guard that returns `[]` for any unrecognized shape and key-maps present exercises (`numero→priority`, `consigne→action` with `type` fallback, `type→pattern`, `modele ?? phrase→example`). `RawDiagnosticBlock.ordonnance` retyped to `unknown` so the guard owns the shape check.
  - `app/diagnostic/page.tsx:316`: belt-and-braces `(diagnostic.ordonnance ?? []).slice(0, 3)` — if a future backend shape change breaks the mapper invariant, the page renders fewer cards instead of crashing. Mock-card padding (tops up to 3) still kicks in when backend returns fewer exercises.

## In progress

_(none — F-061 closed end-to-end. F-061.1 opens next if picker/slug work is prioritized, else F-062.)_

---

## Queued — core product wiring (F-061.1, F-062 to F-064)

**F-061.1** 📋 Tâche 3 topic picker + slug resolution
- Hardcoded `TOPIC` literal in `components/speaking/Tache3Session.tsx:29-34` still renders the "réseaux sociaux" prompt regardless of URL slug. Silent `topicId=1` fallback in `Tache3Session.tsx:48` sends the same topic_id for every session.
- Add `app/speaking/tache-3/page.tsx` — Tache3Picker, mirroring Tache2Picker. Consume existing backend `GET /api/recordings/tache3-topics` (recordings.py:487) which already returns `{topics: [{id, title, theme, sous_theme, difficulty, prompt_{fr,en,es}}], gates: {above_a2}}` — frontend isn't calling it yet.
- Decide on slug-vs-id URL shape: `TestTopic` model has no `slug` column today (only `id, title, theme, sous_theme, tache_3_prompt_*, tache_3_difficulty, is_active`). Either add a `slug` column backend-side OR keep numeric-id URLs and have the picker route to `/speaking/tache-3/<id>`.
- Update `components/speaking/SpeakingLanding.tsx:56` — currently hardcodes `'/speaking/tache-3/environnement'`. Route to the picker instead.
- Replace `Tache3Session`'s hardcoded TOPIC literal with a fetch on mount; show real prompt/difficulty/theme; proper "topic not found" error state instead of `|| 1`.
- Does not block core functionality — F-061 works end-to-end today with the fallback. This is UX cleanup.

**F-062** 📋 Tâche 2 real recording (multi-turn conversation)

These complete the MVP loop: user can do a real TCF session, get real analysis, see real feedback.

**F-062** 📋 Tâche 2 real recording (multi-turn conversation)
- Reuse useAudioRecorder + VuMeter primitives from F-061
- Wire Tache2Session.tsx: PTT mode, 60s per turn cap
- POST /api/conversations + /api/conversations/{id}/turns per turn
- After 3 turns: fetch conversation, cherry-pick feedback_grid.tache_2 for TranscriptReviewPanel
- Route to /diagnostic?session=<recordingId> on completion
- Depends on: F-061

**F-063** 📋 Tâche 1 real recording (AI examiner conversation)
- Reuse useAudioRecorder + VuMeter primitives
- Wire Tache1Session.tsx with examiner turn playback (TTS audio)
- POST /api/conversations with tache_mode=1
- Handle 4-turn examiner-user-examiner-user flow
- Depends on: F-061, F-062

**F-064** 📋 Lesson detail + quiz real data
- `app/raccourci/lesson/[id]/page.tsx` fetches GET /api/raccourci/lessons/{id}
- Quiz component submits to POST /api/raccourci/lessons/{id}/complete
- Lesson completion updates user progress state
- HomeScreen lesson list re-renders with updated completion state

---

## Queued — polish for real-feel (F-065 to F-067)

**F-065** 📋 Profile page real data
- Replace hardcoded "Chadi" / "chadi@example.com" / "TCF C1 (level 5)" / "June 7, 2026" / Day 7 / 4/16 / 47 days
- Pull from useAuthStore.user (email, full_name, target_level, exam_profile, exam_date, goal, current_level)
- Preply CTA stays as-is (links to Chadi's Preply profile)
- Edit icon on exam date triggers a mini-editor that PATCHes /api/users/me

**F-066** 📋 Daily action card B — smart practice recommendation
- Currently hardcoded to "Tâche 2 · Agence de voyages"
- Replace with endpoint that returns recommended practice based on user's bottleneck couche
- Backend: new endpoint GET /api/raccourci/recommended-practice
- Frontend: HomeScreen fetches and renders recommendation
- May be deferred to post-launch if bottleneck detection requires session history

**F-067** 📋 Streak endpoint + wiring
- Backend: GET /api/users/me/streak returns last-7-days practice activity count
- Frontend: HomeScreen reads from streak endpoint, renders "Day N · Current streak"
- Current fallback shows "Start your streak today" — keep as empty state

---

## Queued — methodology / content gaps (F-068 to F-070)

**F-068** 📋 TEF option in onboarding
- Split "Immigration" goal into "Immigration — TCF Canada" and "Immigration — TEF Canada"
- mapOnboardingToBackend routes second option to exam_profile='tef'
- No backend change needed (exam_profile column already accepts 'tef')

**F-069** 📋 French lesson titles in backend seeder
- Update seed_topics.py or raccourci seeder
- Lesson titles must be French ("Conjugaison" not "Conjugation", "Prépositions" not "Prepositions")
- Lesson short_descriptions stay in interface language (English for EN users)
- Reseed the raccourci_lessons table on dev DB before launch

**F-070** 📋 CEFR → TCF /699 score mapping
- Backend analysis engine must emit tcfScore (0-699) alongside noteGlobale (0-20) and cefrBand
- Map internal score → TCF band using official TCF Oral rubric (0-699)
- Frontend diagnostic page hero switches from {noteGlobale}/20 to {tcfScore} / 699 {cefrBand}
- Paywall radar already shows this; make sure diagnostic matches

---

## Queued — launch prep (F-071 to F-079)

Previously called "F-060 launch prep" umbrella. Split into discrete tickets here.

**F-071** 📋 Password reset flow
- Backend: POST /api/auth/forgot-password (email link), POST /api/auth/reset-password (token + new password)
- Frontend: /forgot-password screen, /reset-password/[token] screen
- Email sending: SendGrid or Resend

**F-072** 📋 JWT expiry + refresh token handling
- Backend: shorten JWT to 1 hour, issue refresh tokens (7 days) on login/register
- Backend: POST /api/auth/refresh endpoint
- Frontend: api.ts intercepts 401, tries refresh, retries original call
- Frontend: on refresh failure, clearAuth and redirect to /login

**F-073** 📋 Onboarding resume-from-step
- Each onboarding step component accepts initialValue prop
- OnboardingFlow reads useOnboardingStore on mount, resumes from last populated step
- If user refreshes mid-onboarding, they don't lose progress

**F-074** 📋 422 email TLD error messaging
- Signup page parses 422 response body for validation detail
- Shows specific message "Please use a valid email address (not .local, .test, or .example)" instead of generic "Could not create account"

**F-075** 📋 Audio upload security hardening (carried from F-050)
- Backend: server-side size cap on /api/audio/upload (5 MB hard limit)
- Backend: user_id on Recording model + auth check on /api/audio/{id} serve route
- Current state: raw filesystem paths exposed as URLs with no ownership check

**F-076** 📋 Background tab timer drift fix (carried from F-050)
- Frontend: PTT 60s cap in Tache2Session uses performance.now()+setInterval
- Chrome throttles setInterval in hidden tabs, timer drifts
- Fix: use Date.now() deltas (already pattern in useAudioRecorder)

**F-077** 📋 Production environment config
- Backend: production .env with real secrets
- Backend: CORS allow_origins updated to production domain (remove localhost)
- Frontend: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL for production
- Deploy backend to production host (DigitalOcean or similar)
- Deploy frontend to Vercel production

**F-078** 📋 Asset drop — 11 missing 3D illustrations
- Source via Canva or Fiverr
- Files needed: key.png, calendar.png, target.png, stairs.png, globe.png, graduation-ca.png, passport.png, flag-canada.png, flag-spain.png, flag-uk.png, speech-bubble variants
- Drop into fluentpath-frontend/public/icons/

**F-079** 📋 Calibration with real students
- Recruit 5-10 past Preply students with known TCF scores
- Have them record sessions in the launched product
- Compare FluentPath predicted TCF score vs actual exam score
- Tune analysis engine thresholds if gaps exceed ±50 points on /699 scale

## Deferred — post-launch (Week 3+)

⏸ **Stripe integration** — deferred per explicit decision. Backend first, revenue later.
⏸ **Test-drive recording before paywall** — post-launch A/B test for conversion optimization
⏸ **Writing module (Expression Écrite)** — full TCF coverage beyond Expression Orale
⏸ **Exam Simulation mode** — distinct from Learning Mode (current default)
⏸ **Mock Exam mode** — separate scoring mode recommended after completing Le Raccourci
⏸ **Mobile PWA install prompt + service worker** — Phase 1 is responsive web
⏸ **Cross-session pattern detection** — locked behind 3-session minimum
⏸ **PDF export of diagnostic** — not required for launch
⏸ **Teacher dashboard** — aggregate analytics across students, Preply integration
⏸ **Referral system** — viral growth loop
⏸ **Email notifications** — "You haven't practiced in 5 days"
⏸ **Onboarding tutorial overlay** — first-time UX walkthrough

---

## Known issues — not blocking

- `components/onboarding/TargetScoreSelect.tsx:98` — pre-existing v0 unknown-narrowing TypeScript error. Cosmetic, doesn't break build.
- Backend `main.py` CORS has `allow_credentials=True` — not needed for JWT-only but harmless; leave it.
- Paywall.tsx has a lingering `{/* ── Test-drive section ─────── */}` code comment referencing deprecated feature. Cosmetic.

---

## Working protocol reminder

- Every new ticket drafted must reference this BACKLOG.md and use the next available F-0xx number.
- Every completed ticket must be marked ✅ in this file with a brief summary of what shipped.
- If this file conflicts with memory or a past conversation, this file wins.
- External tracker equivalent: there isn't one. This file IS the tracker.
