# FluentPath Backlog

**Source of truth** for FluentPath sprint work. Maintained in the frontend repo because most active work is here, but covers both frontend and backend.

**Last updated:** 2026-04-23
**Sprint window:** April 21 – May 4, 2026

## How this file works

- Every ticket has a unique F-0xx ID. IDs are never reused or renumbered.
- Tickets reference repos by their local paths: `fluentpath-frontend/` or `tcf-oral-tool/`.
- Status markers: ✅ shipped · 🔄 in progress · 📋 queued · ⏸ deferred
- When a ticket is closed, mark ✅ and leave it in place. Do not delete.
- When a new ticket is created, append it with the next available F-0xx number.
- When a ticket spawns sub-work, either break it into new F-0xx tickets OR add numbered sub-items. Do not nest sub-phases beyond one level.

## In progress

_(none — F-059 closed, F-061 opens next)_

## Queued — core product wiring (F-061 to F-064)

These complete the MVP loop: user can do a real TCF session, get real analysis, see real feedback.

**F-061** 📋 Tâche 3 real recording + upload + diagnostic routing
- Create `hooks/useAudioRecorder.ts` wrapping MediaRecorder API
- Wire `components/speaking/Tache3Session.tsx` to real recording (replace mock)
- VuMeter reads real audio levels via Web Audio API AnalyserNode
- CountdownTimer synced to recorder.durationMs
- Hard cap at 3 minutes (180_000 ms)
- Mic permission denial UX
- On stop: POST /api/recordings/upload, route to /diagnostic?session=<id>
- Diagnostic page reads `session` query param, fetches real data via api.sessions.getDiagnostic
- Out of scope: T1, T2 sessions (separate tickets below)

**F-062** 📋 Tâche 2 real recording (multi-turn conversation)
- Reuse useAudioRecorder + VuMeter primitives from F-061
- Wire Tache2Session.tsx: PTT mode, 60s per turn cap
- POST /api/conversations + /api/conversations/{id}/turns per turn
- After 3 turns: fetch conversation, cherry-pick feedback_grid.tache_2 for TranscriptReviewPanel
- Route to /diagnostic?session=<recordingId> on completion
- Depends on: F-061

**F-063** 📋 Tâche 1 real recording (AI examiner conversation)
- Reuse useAudioRecorder + VuMeter primitives
- Wire Tache1Session.tsx with examiner turn playback (TTS audio)
- POST /api/conversations with tache_mode=1
- Handle 4-turn examiner-user-examiner-user flow
- Depends on: F-061, F-062

**F-064** 📋 Lesson detail + quiz real data
- `app/raccourci/lesson/[id]/page.tsx` fetches GET /api/raccourci/lessons/{id}
- Quiz component submits to POST /api/raccourci/lessons/{id}/complete
- Lesson completion updates user progress state
- HomeScreen lesson list re-renders with updated completion state

---

## Queued — polish for real-feel (F-065 to F-067)

**F-065** 📋 Profile page real data
- Replace hardcoded "Chadi" / "chadi@example.com" / "TCF C1 (level 5)" / "June 7, 2026" / Day 7 / 4/16 / 47 days
- Pull from useAuthStore.user (email, full_name, target_level, exam_profile, exam_date, goal, current_level)
- Preply CTA stays as-is (links to Chadi's Preply profile)
- Edit icon on exam date triggers a mini-editor that PATCHes /api/users/me

**F-066** 📋 Daily action card B — smart practice recommendation
- Currently hardcoded to "Tâche 2 · Agence de voyages"
- Replace with endpoint that returns recommended practice based on user's bottleneck couche
- Backend: new endpoint GET /api/raccourci/recommended-practice
- Frontend: HomeScreen fetches and renders recommendation
- May be deferred to post-launch if bottleneck detection requires session history

**F-067** 📋 Streak endpoint + wiring
- Backend: GET /api/users/me/streak returns last-7-days practice activity count
- Frontend: HomeScreen reads from streak endpoint, renders "Day N · Current streak"
- Current fallback shows "Start your streak today" — keep as empty state

---

## Queued — methodology / content gaps (F-068 to F-070)

**F-068** 📋 TEF option in onboarding
- Split "Immigration" goal into "Immigration — TCF Canada" and "Immigration — TEF Canada"
- mapOnboardingToBackend routes second option to exam_profile='tef'
- No backend change needed (exam_profile column already accepts 'tef')

**F-069** 📋 French lesson titles in backend seeder
- Update seed_topics.py or raccourci seeder
- Lesson titles must be French ("Conjugaison" not "Conjugation", "Prépositions" not "Prepositions")
- Lesson short_descriptions stay in interface language (English for EN users)
- Reseed the raccourci_lessons table on dev DB before launch

**F-070** 📋 CEFR → TCF /699 score mapping
- Backend analysis engine must emit tcfScore (0-699) alongside noteGlobale (0-20) and cefrBand
- Map internal score → TCF band using official TCF Oral rubric (0-699)
- Frontend diagnostic page hero switches from {noteGlobale}/20 to {tcfScore} / 699 {cefrBand}
- Paywall radar already shows this; make sure diagnostic matches

---

## Queued — launch prep (F-071 to F-079)

Previously called "F-060 launch prep" umbrella. Split into discrete tickets here.

**F-071** 📋 Password reset flow
- Backend: POST /api/auth/forgot-password (email link), POST /api/auth/reset-password (token + new password)
- Frontend: /forgot-password screen, /reset-password/[token] screen
- Email sending: SendGrid or Resend

**F-072** 📋 JWT expiry + refresh token handling
- Backend: shorten JWT to 1 hour, issue refresh tokens (7 days) on login/register
- Backend: POST /api/auth/refresh endpoint
- Frontend: api.ts intercepts 401, tries refresh, retries original call
- Frontend: on refresh failure, clearAuth and redirect to /login

**F-073** 📋 Onboarding resume-from-step
- Each onboarding step component accepts initialValue prop
- OnboardingFlow reads useOnboardingStore on mount, resumes from last populated step
- If user refreshes mid-onboarding, they don't lose progress

**F-074** 📋 422 email TLD error messaging
- Signup page parses 422 response body for validation detail
- Shows specific message "Please use a valid email address (not .local, .test, or .example)" instead of generic "Could not create account"

**F-075** 📋 Audio upload security hardening (carried from F-050)
- Backend: server-side size cap on /api/audio/upload (5 MB hard limit)
- Backend: user_id on Recording model + auth check on /api/audio/{id} serve route
- Current state: raw filesystem paths exposed as URLs with no ownership check

**F-076** 📋 Background tab timer drift fix (carried from F-050)
- Frontend: PTT 60s cap in Tache2Session uses performance.now()+setInterval
- Chrome throttles setInterval in hidden tabs, timer drifts
- Fix: use Date.now() deltas (already pattern in useAudioRecorder)

**F-077** 📋 Production environment config
- Backend: production .env with real secrets
- Backend: CORS allow_origins updated to production domain (remove localhost)
- Frontend: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL for production
- Deploy backend to production host (DigitalOcean or similar)
- Deploy frontend to Vercel production

**F-078** 📋 Asset drop — 11 missing 3D illustrations
- Source via Canva or Fiverr
- Files needed: key.png, calendar.png, target.png, stairs.png, globe.png, graduation-ca.png, passport.png, flag-canada.png, flag-spain.png, flag-uk.png, speech-bubble variants
- Drop into fluentpath-frontend/public/icons/

**F-079** 📋 Calibration with real students
- Recruit 5-10 past Preply students with known TCF scores
- Have them record sessions in the launched product
- Compare FluentPath predicted TCF score vs actual exam score
- Tune analysis engine thresholds if gaps exceed ±50 points on /699 scale

## Deferred — post-launch (Week 3+)

⏸ **Stripe integration** — deferred per explicit decision. Backend first, revenue later.
⏸ **Test-drive recording before paywall** — post-launch A/B test for conversion optimization
⏸ **Writing module (Expression Écrite)** — full TCF coverage beyond Expression Orale
⏸ **Exam Simulation mode** — distinct from Learning Mode (current default)
⏸ **Mock Exam mode** — separate scoring mode recommended after completing Le Raccourci
⏸ **Mobile PWA install prompt + service worker** — Phase 1 is responsive web
⏸ **Cross-session pattern detection** — locked behind 3-session minimum
⏸ **PDF export of diagnostic** — not required for launch
⏸ **Teacher dashboard** — aggregate analytics across students, Preply integration
⏸ **Referral system** — viral growth loop
⏸ **Email notifications** — "You haven't practiced in 5 days"
⏸ **Onboarding tutorial overlay** — first-time UX walkthrough

---

## Known issues — not blocking

- `components/onboarding/TargetScoreSelect.tsx:98` — pre-existing v0 unknown-narrowing TypeScript error. Cosmetic, doesn't break build.
- Backend `main.py` CORS has `allow_credentials=True` — not needed for JWT-only but harmless; leave it.
- Paywall.tsx has a lingering `{/* ── Test-drive section ─────── */}` code comment referencing deprecated feature. Cosmetic.

## Working protocol reminder

- Every new ticket drafted must reference this BACKLOG.md and use the next available F-0xx number.
- Every completed ticket must be marked ✅ in this file with a brief summary of what shipped.
- If this file conflicts with memory or a past conversation, this file wins.
- External tracker equivalent: there isn't one. This file IS the tracker.
