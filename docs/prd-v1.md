# Le Méthodic — Product Requirements Document v1
**UI-First Execution Plan · Manual Mode**

> **Generated:** May 21, 2026
> **Replaces:** `lemethodic-backlog-2026-05-18.md` (orchestrator backlog deprecated; parse_backlog / dispatch_agent / n8n-workflow files dead)
> **Source of truth:** this file. `BACKLOG.md` in each repo points back to PRD entries; do not let the two diverge.

---

## 1. Framework

### 1.1 Manual Mode (locked May 21)
The orchestrator path (parse_backlog → dispatch_agent → n8n) is killed. Cost projected $200–400/sprint, unaffordable at Y0 revenue. Replacement workflow:

- **Plan with Opus** (claude.ai) — one micro-feature briefed per session, brief becomes the PRD entry below
- **Execute with Sonnet** (Claude Code in VS Code) — implements the brief in one focused session
- **/compact between sessions** with focus directive, e.g. `/compact focus on UI-002 acceptance criteria`
- **Operating cost ceiling:** ~$20–50/mo Claude.ai

### 1.2 UI-First Sequencing
Backend moats (F-336–340 RAG retrieval modes, F-322 validator, F-327 voice pipeline, F-336+ embeddings) are scheduled in Sections 3–5 — **after** UI shells are complete. Rationale: a working UI with mocks generates user-flow feedback and lets beta cohorts validate experience. A backend without a UI cannot ship.

This is not "skipping the moat." Memory #23 V2-or-nothing posture holds: soft-beta = V2 with Le Maître + RAG + activation layer. The sequence just inverts the build order so user-visible surfaces compile first.

### 1.3 One Micro-Feature Per Session
Each PRD entry below is one Claude Code session. No multi-feature dispatches, no parallel agent work.

**Session discipline:**
1. Open session: paste the PRD entry as the first message to Sonnet
2. Sonnet writes tests first (or alongside), then code, then runs the tests
3. Close session: `git commit` + push the feature branch
4. Update the PRD entry `Status` line to `Shipped` and add the merge commit SHA
5. Between sessions: `/compact focus on <entry-id> <specific aspect>` before opening the next

### 1.4 Section Map (this PRD)
| § | Section | ID Range | Count | Maps to 4-Step Strategic Sequence |
|---|---------|----------|-------|-----------------------------------|
| 1 | UI Shells | UI-001 to UI-015 | 15 | Step 0 (parallel with data layer) |
| 2 | Mock Data + UI Polish | MOCK-001 to MOCK-012 | ~12 | Step 1 |
| 3 | Backend Wiring | BE-001 to BE-022 | ~22 | Step 2b |
| 4 | Content Pipeline | CON-001 to CON-014 | ~14 | Step 2b → 3 |
| 5 | AI Infrastructure | AI-001 to AI-018 | ~18 | Step 2a → 3 |
| 6 | Legal + Business Formation | LGL-001 to LGL-008 | ~8 | Step 3 |
| 7 | Launch | LCH-001 to LCH-009 | ~9 | Step 3 |
| | **Total** | | **~98** | |

## 2. Conventions

### 2.1 Git
- **Backend repo** (`chadovsky/lemethodic-backend`) — branch from `master`. Local: `C:\Users\pc\Downloads\tcf-oral-tool\tcf-oral-tool`
- **Frontend repo** (`chadovsky/lemethodic-frontend`) — branch from `main`. Local: `C:\Users\pc\Downloads\fluentpath-frontend`
- **Per-feature branch naming:** `feat/<id-lowercased>-<short-name>`
  - Example: `feat/ui-001-landing-hero`
  - Example: `feat/be-007-vocab-list-endpoint`
- **Merge strategy:** squash-merge to base branch
- **Tagging:** tag at end of each Section, or every 5 shipped entries — whichever comes first. Tag format: `v0.<section>.<count>` (e.g. `v0.1.5` after UI-005 ships)

### 2.2 Tests = Spec
Tests are written first or alongside code. Never after. If you find yourself writing tests after, stop and re-open the session.
- **Frontend:** vitest for unit/component tests, Playwright for e2e flows
- **Backend:** pytest for unit + integration tests
- Every PRD entry below lists specific test file paths and test names that must exist green before the branch can squash-merge

### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria
Format: **Given / When / Then**. 2–5 acceptance lines per entry. Each acceptance line must map to at least one named test.

### 2.4 Status Vocabulary
- `Not Started` — entry exists in this PRD, no branch created
- `In Progress` — branch exists, work underway, tests not all green
- `Shipped` — squash-merged to base, branch deleted, PRD updated with merge SHA

### 2.5 PowerShell-Safe Command Style
All shell commands written for Chadi must be single-line PowerShell-safe. Escape curly braces as `'stash@{N}'` (single quotes). No multi-line heredocs.

### 2.6 Out-of-Scope Discipline
Every entry has an explicit **Out** list. Items in Out are not "not needed for launch" — they are scheduled in a later section. Adding them in the current entry creates rework.

---

## Section 1 — UI Shells (UI-001 to UI-015)

**Goal:** every user-visible surface renders with placeholder content. No real data, no live API calls, no AI integrations. Each entry compiles, renders responsively, has a Playwright smoke test confirming it loads, and ships behind a feature branch.

**Why this section first:** rendering all surfaces validates information architecture before any backend cost is incurred. Beta cohort can be invited to navigate the shell and surface flow problems before AI/content investment.

---

### UI-001 — Landing page hero

**Status:** Shipped — squash-merged `547c712` (feat/ui-001-landing-hero → main)
**Branch:** `feat/ui-001-landing-hero` (FE, from `main`)
**Effort:** 1 session (~2–4h)

#### Scope
**In:**
- Headline: **"Pass TCF Canada. Get to Quebec."** (locked per memory — hero message)
- Subheadline: one-line positioning Le Méthodic as a method-based oral exam prep platform for anglophone TCF Canada candidates pursuing Quebec PR (exact wording iterates in MOCK-001)
- Primary CTA button: text placeholder "Start your prep" — routes to `/signup` (404 acceptable at this stage; route stub created here)
- Background: solid color drawn from brand palette via CSS variables (no images, no video, no avatar)
- Responsive: renders correctly at 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1280px+ (desktop)
- Brand typography: pick a distinctive display font for the headline (not Inter, not Roboto, not system) and a refined body font — choices recorded in `tailwind.config.js` or `app/fonts.ts`

**Out (deferred, do not add):**
- Le Maître avatar (scheduled in Section 5 alongside ElevenLabs voice work; adding the avatar shell here creates rework when the real persona ships)
- Wispr Flow–style animated product demo (scheduled in MOCK-002; blocked on pre-work: Wispr reference screenshots, Nanobanana sample images)
- Social proof badges, testimonials (UI-003)
- Pricing teaser (UI-004)
- Footer (UI-004)
- A/B variant routing
- Analytics (PostHog/Plausible) — Section 7

#### Acceptance (Given/When/Then)
1. **Given** a visitor on desktop (1280×800), **When** they load `/`, **Then** headline, subheadline, and CTA all render above the fold without scroll.
2. **Given** a visitor on mobile (375×667), **When** they load `/`, **Then** the hero renders without horizontal overflow and the CTA has a minimum 44×44px tap target.
3. **Given** a visitor on the hero, **When** they click the CTA, **Then** the router navigates to `/signup` (a stub page that renders an empty container is acceptable).
4. **Given** the hero rendered, **When** Lighthouse runs against `/`, **Then** Accessibility ≥ 95 and Performance ≥ 90 (no images means this is easy to hit).

#### Tests
- `tests/unit/landing/Hero.test.tsx` (vitest) — renders headline, subheadline, CTA; CTA has correct href; passes ARIA role checks
- `tests/e2e/landing-hero.spec.ts` (Playwright) — desktop viewport loads `/`, hero visible, CTA click navigates to `/signup`; repeats on mobile viewport

#### Files Touched
- `app/page.tsx` — root landing route, renders `<Hero />`
- `app/signup/page.tsx` — stub page so the CTA click doesn't 404 (empty container is fine)
- `components/landing/Hero.tsx` — new component
- `tailwind.config.js` or `app/fonts.ts` — font registration if using next/font
- `tests/unit/landing/Hero.test.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/landing-hero.spec.ts`

#### Dependencies
None. This is the first UI shell — no upstream blockers.

#### Notes
- Headline copy is locked. Sub and CTA copy may iterate in MOCK-001 polish pass.
- Do not add Le Maître avatar. ElevenLabs work happens in Section 5 (AI Infrastructure). Premature avatar placement creates rework.
- Distinctive font choice matters here — this is the first impression and the brand signal. Pick something with character; do not default to Inter.

---

### UI-002 — Landing persona-match section

**Status:** Shipped — squash-merged `b4677e0` (feat/ui-002-landing-persona → main)
**Branch:** `feat/ui-002-landing-persona` (FE, from `main`)
**Effort:** 1 session (~2–4h)

#### Scope
**In:**
- Section heading: "Built for visa-urgent anglophone candidates" (or similar — exact copy provisional)
- Three-column value-prop block (1 column on mobile, 3 on desktop ≥1024px):
  - Column 1: TCF Canada–specific (not generic French exam prep)
  - Column 2: Designed for English speakers (5-couche layer "Les Réflexes Anglais" surfaces here)
  - Column 3: Method-based, not vocabulary memorization
- Each column: icon placeholder (geometric SVG, not avatar/photo), heading, 1–2 sentence body
- Renders directly below `<Hero />` on `/`
- Responsive: stacks vertically below 1024px

**Out:**
- Real icons (placeholder geometric SVGs only; final iconography is MOCK-003)
- Animated reveal on scroll (Motion library — scheduled in MOCK-005)
- Stats / numbers ("90% of users pass" — needs real data, scheduled in Section 7)
- DALF C1 secondary persona — not surfaced here (primary persona only on landing per GTM lock May 17)

#### Acceptance (Given/When/Then)
1. **Given** desktop ≥1024px, **When** the visitor scrolls past the hero, **Then** three columns render side-by-side with equal height.
2. **Given** mobile <1024px, **When** the visitor scrolls past the hero, **Then** columns stack vertically with consistent spacing.
3. **Given** the section rendered, **When** Lighthouse audits accessibility, **Then** all heading hierarchy is correct (h2 for section, h3 for columns) and contrast ratios pass WCAG AA.

#### Tests
- `tests/unit/landing/PersonaMatch.test.tsx` (vitest) — renders 3 columns, correct heading hierarchy
- `tests/e2e/landing-persona.spec.ts` (Playwright) — desktop shows 3 columns, mobile shows stacked layout

#### Files Touched
- `app/page.tsx` — add `<PersonaMatch />` below `<Hero />`
- `components/landing/PersonaMatch.tsx` — new component
- `components/landing/icons/` — geometric SVG placeholders (3 files)
- `tests/unit/landing/PersonaMatch.test.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/landing-persona.spec.ts`

#### Dependencies
- UI-001 must be `Shipped` (this section attaches below the hero)

---

### UI-003 — Landing methodology preview (5-couche visual)

**Status:** Shipped — squash-merged `ba435e4` (feat/ui-003-landing-methodology → main)
**Branch:** `feat/ui-003-landing-methodology` (FE, from `main`)
**Effort:** 1 session (~3–5h)

#### Scope
**In:**
- Section heading: "The 5-Couche Method" (locked terminology per memory)
- Visual representation of the five layers, in order:
  1. Le Fond
  2. Les Moules des Idées
  3. Les Moules
  4. Les Réflexes Anglais
  5. La Voix
- Each layer renders as a horizontal band, stacked, with the layer name and a 1-sentence description
- Layers are visually distinct (different background tones from a single palette ramp — no rainbow)
- Bottom CTA: "See how it works" → routes to `/method` (stub page, can 404 or render empty)

**Out:**
- Real interactive demo of the method (deferred to MOCK-006 with placeholder audio, then AI-005 with real voice)
- Animated layer reveal (MOCK-005)
- Linkage to L'École lesson list (Section 3 wires this)
- Beacco / FEI rubric references (these stay in admin/methodology docs, not user-facing landing)

#### Acceptance (Given/When/Then)
1. **Given** the methodology section loaded, **When** rendered on desktop, **Then** five layers display in vertical stack with consistent height and clear visual separation.
2. **Given** the section on mobile, **When** rendered, **Then** the five-layer stack remains readable (text doesn't truncate, layer names visible).
3. **Given** the CTA at the bottom, **When** clicked, **Then** the router navigates to `/method`.

#### Tests
- `tests/unit/landing/MethodologyPreview.test.tsx` (vitest) — renders 5 layers in correct order with correct French labels
- `tests/e2e/landing-methodology.spec.ts` (Playwright) — section visible, layer order correct, CTA navigates

#### Files Touched
- `app/page.tsx` — add `<MethodologyPreview />` below `<PersonaMatch />`
- `app/method/page.tsx` — stub page
- `components/landing/MethodologyPreview.tsx` — new component
- `components/landing/CouchesLayer.tsx` — single-layer sub-component
- `tests/unit/landing/MethodologyPreview.test.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/landing-methodology.spec.ts`

#### Dependencies
- UI-001, UI-002 must be `Shipped`

#### Notes
- The 5-couche is the brand moat surfaced visually. Get the typography and layer differentiation right — it's the proof point that Le Méthodic isn't another Duolingo clone.
- Exact French copy for each layer description should be reviewed by Chadi before merge.

### UI-004 — Landing pricing teaser + footer

**Status:** Shipped — squash-merged `2c92c69` (feat/ui-004-pricing-footer → main)
**Branch:** `feat/ui-004-pricing-footer` (FE, from `main`)
**Effort:** 1 session (~3–4h)

#### Scope
**In:**
- Pricing teaser section (above footer):
  - 5 tiers as cards: $9–19 à la carte / $19 Daily Bundle / $29 Exam Bundle / $49 Pro / $199 Sprint (one-time)
  - Each card: tier name, price, 2-line description, "Choose" CTA (routes to `/signup?tier=<slug>`)
  - Daily Bundle visually highlighted as "Most popular" (positioning per memory)
- Footer:
  - Logo placeholder
  - 3 link columns: Product (L'École, Le Vocabulaire, Le Diagnostic), Company (About, Method, Blog), Legal (ToS, Privacy — both stub `/legal/tos` and `/legal/privacy`)
  - Copyright line: "© 2026 Le Méthodic"
- Sticky nav header on top of page: logo + Sign in (routes to `/login` stub)

**Out:**
- Live Stripe checkout integration (Section 6 — LGL after Atlas + EIN)
- Free tier promotion (free funnel deferred to V1.1 per memory #23 Q8 — do not surface a free option here)
- Tier comparison table (deferred — current cards are enough for landing teaser)
- Currency switcher (USD only at launch)
- Newsletter signup in footer (deferred to Section 7 marketing)

#### Acceptance (Given/When/Then)
1. **Given** desktop, **When** the visitor scrolls to pricing, **Then** five tier cards render in a row (or 3+2 grid below 1280px) with Daily Bundle visually distinct.
2. **Given** mobile, **When** the visitor scrolls to pricing, **Then** cards stack vertically with Daily Bundle still visually distinct.
3. **Given** any tier card, **When** the CTA is clicked, **Then** the router navigates to `/signup?tier=<tier-slug>` with the correct query param.
4. **Given** the footer rendered, **When** the visitor clicks ToS or Privacy, **Then** the router navigates to the stub legal page.
5. **Given** the sticky header, **When** the visitor scrolls down the page, **Then** the header remains visible at the top.

#### Tests
- `tests/unit/landing/PricingTeaser.test.tsx` (vitest) — renders 5 tiers, Daily Bundle highlighted, CTAs have correct query params
- `tests/unit/landing/Footer.test.tsx` (vitest) — renders 3 link columns + copyright
- `tests/unit/landing/StickyHeader.test.tsx` (vitest) — renders logo + Sign in link
- `tests/e2e/landing-pricing.spec.ts` (Playwright) — clicks Daily Bundle CTA, lands on `/signup?tier=daily-bundle`
- `tests/e2e/landing-footer.spec.ts` (Playwright) — footer links navigate correctly

#### Files Touched
- `app/page.tsx` — add `<PricingTeaser />` and `<Footer />`
- `app/layout.tsx` — add `<StickyHeader />` to root layout
- `app/legal/tos/page.tsx`, `app/legal/privacy/page.tsx` — stub pages
- `app/login/page.tsx` — stub page
- `components/landing/PricingTeaser.tsx`, `components/landing/Footer.tsx`, `components/layout/StickyHeader.tsx`
- 5 test files as listed

#### Dependencies
- UI-001, UI-002, UI-003 must be `Shipped`

#### Notes
- Pricing copy is locked per memory. Do not invent new tiers or rename.
- The "Most popular" highlight on Daily Bundle is a GTM positioning decision (memory: $19 Daily Bundle is the anchor tier).

---

### UI-005 — Sign-up form shell

**Status:** Not Started
**Branch:** `feat/ui-005-signup-form-shell` (FE, from `main`)
**Effort:** 1 session (~3–5h)

#### Scope
**In:**
- `/signup` page replaces the empty stub from UI-001
- Form fields: email, password, confirm-password
- Client-side validation only at this stage:
  - Email format
  - Password ≥ 8 chars
  - Password match
- Validation errors shown inline below each field
- Submit button: disabled until validation passes; on click, shows a loading state then redirects to `/onboarding` (stub page)
- Reads `?tier=<slug>` query param from URL (set by pricing CTAs in UI-004) and displays "Signing up for: <tier>" above the form
- "Already have an account? Sign in" link → routes to `/login` stub
- Responsive: form is single column, max-width ~440px, centered

**Out:**
- Real auth wiring (Supabase / NextAuth / custom JWT — Section 3, BE-001)
- OAuth (Google, Apple) — scheduled in Section 3
- Email verification flow — scheduled in Section 3
- hCaptcha integration — scheduled in Section 3 (F-406 auth hardening)
- Password strength meter beyond length check — defer to MOCK-008
- Server-side validation — defer to BE-001

#### Acceptance (Given/When/Then)
1. **Given** a fresh visitor on `/signup`, **When** they leave the email field empty and click Submit, **Then** the Submit button stays disabled and inline error shows "Email is required."
2. **Given** valid email and matching passwords, **When** Submit is clicked, **Then** button shows a loading state for ≥300ms then router navigates to `/onboarding`.
3. **Given** the URL `/signup?tier=daily-bundle`, **When** the page renders, **Then** "Signing up for: Daily Bundle" displays above the form.
4. **Given** mismatched passwords, **When** the user blurs the confirm-password field, **Then** inline error shows "Passwords don't match" and Submit is disabled.
5. **Given** mobile viewport, **When** the page renders, **Then** the form fits in viewport without horizontal scroll and inputs have 44×44px minimum tap target.

#### Tests
- `tests/unit/signup/SignupForm.test.tsx` (vitest) — validation behavior, error messages, submit disabled/enabled states, tier query param display
- `tests/e2e/signup-flow.spec.ts` (Playwright) — fills form, submits, lands on `/onboarding`; tests validation errors; tests tier param

#### Files Touched
- `app/signup/page.tsx` — replaces UI-001 stub with `<SignupForm />`
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` — stub page
- `components/auth/SignupForm.tsx` — new component
- `components/auth/FormField.tsx` — reusable field with inline error
- `lib/validation/signup.ts` — pure validation logic, easy to unit test
- `tests/unit/signup/SignupForm.test.tsx`
- `tests/e2e/signup-flow.spec.ts`

#### Dependencies
- UI-001 must be `Shipped` (the `/signup` stub from UI-001 is replaced here)
- UI-004 should be `Shipped` (pricing CTAs need to be wired to land here with `?tier=<slug>`)

#### Notes
- This is the last UI shell before app interior begins (UI-006 = dashboard shell).
- All validation is client-side. Do NOT wire to any auth backend in this entry. Real auth is BE-001. Adding even a fake POST endpoint creates confusion about what's mocked vs real.

---

### UI-006 to UI-015 — Section 1 remaining entries (titles only)

To be populated in subsequent planning sessions. Order reflects user journey through the app.

| ID | Title | Purpose |
|----|-------|---------|
| UI-006 | App shell (post-login) | Sidebar nav + main content frame, no data |
| UI-007 | Dashboard shell | Progress widgets as placeholders, recent activity stub |
| UI-008 | L'École lesson list view | Grid of 27 lesson cards (Fondations 1–16, Approfondissement 17–27), static |
| UI-009 | L'École lesson detail view | Content area + audio player placeholder + navigation between lessons |
| UI-010 | Le Vocabulaire browse view | Chunk list with filters (CEFR level, source) — UI only, fake data |
| UI-011 | Le Vocabulaire practice view | Flashcard-style shell, front/back placeholder |
| UI-012 | Le Vocabulaire test view | Multi-choice quiz shell |
| UI-013 | Le Diagnostic landing | Persona match, exam overview, "Start Diagnostic" CTA |
| UI-014 | Le Diagnostic Tâche 1/2/3 unified shell | Question display + recording UI placeholder + timer |
| UI-015 | Le Diagnostic results view | 5-couche score breakdown placeholder + recommendations stub |

Each will be populated with the same template structure (Scope/Out/Acceptance/Tests/Files/Dependencies/Notes) when its planning session opens.

---

## Section 2 — Mock Data + UI Polish (MOCK-001 to MOCK-012)

**Goal:** every UI shell from Section 1 displays realistic-looking data, has motion polish, and feels like a finished product even though no backend is wired. This is the section that turns shells into a demo-able product. Beta cohort can be invited at end of this section.

**Strategic step:** maps to Step 1 (data layer continues in parallel; mocks here are JSON fixtures hand-curated by Chadi).

**ID range:** MOCK-001 to MOCK-012. To be populated in subsequent planning sessions.

---

## Section 3 — Backend Wiring (BE-001 to BE-022)

**Goal:** replace mock JSON fixtures with real API calls. One surface at a time. Auth first (BE-001), then read endpoints, then write endpoints. F-406 auth hardening (refresh tokens, rate limits, hCaptcha) ships in this section.

**Strategic step:** maps to Step 2b (surface wiring).

**ID range:** BE-001 to BE-022. To be populated in subsequent planning sessions.

---

## Section 4 — Content Pipeline (CON-001 to CON-014)

**Goal:** real content lives behind the surfaces. F-321 vocab review (1,684 Phase 1 chunks awaiting Chadi triage) lands here. L'École 27 lessons get methodology-visible content. Le Diagnostic Tâche library expands to 50 scenarios (F-061.2 Livraison 2/2).

**Strategic step:** maps to Step 2b → Step 3.

**ID range:** CON-001 to CON-014. To be populated in subsequent planning sessions.

**Critical note:** F-321 vocab CSV review is the highest-leverage Chadi-bottlenecked work right now. CON-001 will be the entry that absorbs that workstream into the PRD.

---

## Section 5 — AI Infrastructure (AI-001 to AI-018)

**Goal:** Le Maître ElevenLabs voice deployed across L'École, Le Vocabulaire, Le Diagnostic onboarding. OpenAI TTS-1-HD remains the examiner voice for Tâches (brand-critical, non-negotiable). RAG layer goes live with 6 retrieval modes. F-322 validator (3 tiers, web admin + Slack + CSV, eager sample Tier B). 2-pass Diagnostic scoring: Pass 2 V1, Pass 1 V1.5+.

**Strategic step:** maps to Step 2a (runtime stack swap) → Step 3.

**ID range:** AI-001 to AI-018. To be populated in subsequent planning sessions.

**Critical note:** Whisper (STT) and Piper (vocab TTS narration) are fine in this section. **Never** swap OpenAI TTS-1-HD for the examiner voice — that's the brand signal locked May 19.

---

## Section 6 — Legal + Business Formation (LGL-001 to LGL-008)

**Goal:** Delaware LLC via Stripe Atlas → EIN → Mercury bank → Stripe activation (B-100 sequence). Lawyer engagement immediate at start of this section, 4-week lead time (B-101, $3–5K CAD legal budget). ToS, privacy policy, pseudonym + NER + retention policy (per architecture lock Q4). Data subject rights + cookie banner.

**Strategic step:** maps to Step 3.

**ID range:** LGL-001 to LGL-008. To be populated in subsequent planning sessions.

---

## Section 7 — Launch (LCH-001 to LCH-009)

**Goal:** Stripe live, payments confirmed end-to-end, monitoring (Sentry / PostHog / uptime), programmatic SEO foundation (M-013), authored blog scaffolding, YouTube channel structure, beta cohort invited (30–50 beta → 200–500 soft → 5K+ Y1 public).

**Strategic step:** maps to Step 3.

**ID range:** LCH-001 to LCH-009. To be populated in subsequent planning sessions.

**Launch gate:** all of Section 1 (UI shells) + all of Section 2 (mocks) + critical path through Sections 3–5 + all of Section 6 must be `Shipped` before LCH-009 (public launch) can ship. Quality-gated, no date pressure (memory lock).

---

## Appendix A — Migration from Old Backlog

The following old-style ticket IDs are absorbed into PRD entries below. As each old ticket is migrated, this table gets a new row.

| Old ID | New PRD ID | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| _(empty)_ | _(empty)_ | Populated as entries are written |

Old IDs continue to appear in git commit history and the deprecated `lemethodic-backlog-2026-05-18.md`. New work must use PRD IDs.

---

## Appendix B — Files Killed by This PRD

The following files are deprecated as of May 21, 2026. Do not reference, do not regenerate:
- `parse_backlog.py` (orchestrator)
- `dispatch_agent.py` (orchestrator)
- `n8n-workflow.json` (orchestrator)
- `lemethodic-workload-allocation.html` (assumed multi-agent capacity, obsolete in solo mode)
- `LeMethodic_Master_Backlog.docx` (was already dead per prior memory lock)

The strategic artifacts from May 17–18 (`lemethodic-architecture-v2.html`, `lemethodic-gtm-v2.html`, `lemethodic-ops-blueprint-v1.html`, `lemethodic-revenue-estimator.html`) remain valid reference documents — they inform the PRD but the PRD is now the execution source of truth.
